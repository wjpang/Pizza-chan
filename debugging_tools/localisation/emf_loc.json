After 3 decades of prosperity and modernisation, the election of Vladislav initiated a rapid decline, ending up in the disaster of Mohacs. Another candidate to the throne was Maximilian of Habsburg who maintained the claim of his father Friedrich III, but since he had already proven to be a capable ruler and would have been likely to use his powerbase in the Empire, Austria and Burgundy to consolidate his authority in Hungary, he was no popular choice.

By the 1440s it had become known as main opponent of royal power. In general, they maintained a healthy balance of power, electing the kings of Denmark in exchange for giving certain lucrative revenues to the King. The nobles in turn generally protected the rights of the common people from excessive taxation, and took on much of the administration of the realm.\\nWith the loss of the Kingdom of Sweden, however, came a break in the balance of power. The heavy losses suffered by royal armies and treasury as well as the loss of prestige gave them the opportunity to seize more power for themselves. They now demand that the King sign a haandfæstning, a document guaranteeing noble privileges as a condition of the nobility's acceptance of the King's continued rule. Among the new rights\\nthey demand is the right to revolt against any King that does not keep all promises, written or spoken, to the noble estate.

The fairs were usually connected to religious celebrations, such as the day of the patron saint of the locality. On these occasions, the rulers granted exemption from duties and taxes thus making the prices of the goods sold cheaper. The privilege of the Fair, in Latin nundinas, was granted or confirmed to a town or city by means of a special royal diploma or of the reigning feudal lord written on parchment and was fitted with a leaden seal inside which the heraldic coat of arms of who he had released him. The diploma describes the motivation, the place and date where the fair was held each year, the duration (generally eight consecutive days) and the relative exemptions (taxes, duties, etc.). This privilege stimulated the influx of buyers from outside, attracted by the possibility of saving and concluding deals in a more convenient way. Important was the function of the \\mastromercato\\ or \\master of the fair\\ which, in addition to regulating the exchange of goods, had control of the criminal jurisdiction of the city limited to the period of the fair.

During the 11th century, however, the “French Feudal Revolution” gave French feudalism a bewildering complexity that existed nowhere else in Europe, as holdings got broken down into ever smaller parts under the emergent classes of seigneurs and castellons. Some regions, such as Toulouse, were brought to heal, but most regions remained largely ruled by small powers with little control from Paris. \\n\\nThe agony of the Hundred Years' War only increased the confusion, as allegiances between the various vassals fluctuated between the Valois and Plantagenet claimants to the throne. The expense of the war left France unable to enforce feudal obligations on several more prominent vassals, but also underlined the need for centralization to mount an effective defense against foreign aggression.

This earthquake proved to be like no other though, the death toll estimated to be about 40,000 and the great capital of Portugal destroyed, through earthquake, tsunami or fire. The earthquake itself was reported to have created crevices 5 metres wide in the city centre. Many retreated to the open spaces of the docks, to see the sea retreat to display a barren, muddy plain. Roughly an hour after the earthquake, a colossal tsunami ripped through [227.GetName] up the River Tejo, destroying all in its path. The shaking and shockwaves from the earthquake and its subsequent tsunami knocked over all varieties of candle and set the city ablaze, turning the already ruined city into a firestorm. \\nBy the time the disaster was over, 85% of [227.GetName] was destroyed and countless works of art, literature, architecture and history were lost. King Joseph I and his court were, by sheer luck, out of [227.GetName] due to his daughter's wish to spend All Saints' Day away from the capital. King Joseph himself developed claustrophobia due to the tragedy, and was terrified of living within walls for the rest of his life, instead opting to move the court to a mass of tents on the outskirts of [227.GetName]. The prime minister, the Marquis of Pombal used this to gain power, leveraging the earthquake to take control of the royal court, and establish himself as the primary political figure in Portugal through his handling of the disaster.",

The troops had their pay delayed due to Spain's recent declaration of bankruptcy, leading to the bankers refusing to authorise payment until they had negotiated with Phillip II. This meant that the King had to send the physical money by sea, which was much more perilous. To make matters worse, 400,000 florins intended for the soldiers were seized by the English after the ships carrying them were forced to take refuge in English ports during a storm. This pushed the tercios too far. They decided to find their pay for themselves, as was a time old tradition, by sacking a major city. They chose the de facto capital of the Seventeen Provinces at the time, Antwerp, from which to take what they were owed. This was due to the treachery of the Spanish commander of Antwerp Citadel, Sancho d'Avila. He attempted to convince the commander of the garrison of German mercenaries to deliver the city into Spanish hands. This, however, had the opposite effect. The Germans began to improvise defences against the Spaniards and a day before the mutinying tercios arrived, 6,000 Walloon mercenaries were let into the city to help defend it.

			"FEE_Monuments_Events.2.T": "Ambras Castle",
			"FEE_Monuments_Events.2.D": "References to an Amras or Omras date back to the 10th century, long before the nearby city of Innsbruck was founded. This early fort was in what was then the southwestern edge of Bavaria and the seat of power of the Counts of Andechs who would become the Margraves of Istria and then later Dukes of the short lived Imperial State of Merania from 1180 to 1248. This original fort was destroyed entirely in 1133 with no traces of it remaining although some materials from the original structure were used in the new Castle that was built. In 1248 the ruins of the castle passed into the hands of Count Albert IV of Tyrol. The modern Castle was built by Archduke Ferdinand II (1529 - 1595), the second son of Emperor Ferdinand I. When he was made the ruler of Tyrol in 1564 Ferdinand II ordered two Italian architects to turn the existing castle into a medieval fortress for his wife Philippine Weiser who he had secretly married due to her being untitled. Ferdinand prepared his family's residence in the Upper Castle while beneath it he had built one of the most artistically important halls of the late Renaissance which has been known as the Spanish Hall since the 19th century. In 1567 Ferdinand II entered Innsbruck as before he was the administrative governor of Bohemia and had lived in Prague since 1547. In 1589 he built another building, the Heldens Rustkammer west of the Lower Castle to house his collection of 'Heroes', the first systematic presentation of objects in the history of museums. Ambras Castle was the residence of Philippine and a place for Ferdinand II to house his weapons, armor, portraits, objects as well as various rare and precious objects. Philippine became a popular and beloved figure through her charity and willingness to help people, especially the commoners of Tyrol. After Ferdinand II died in 1595 the castle was inherited by his second son Charles of Burgau who ignored it and eventually sold it to Emperor Rudolf II in 1606 who, while living in Prague, left the Castle alone. In the ensuing years the castle was left to its own devices and seldom lived in. Lax preservation attempts ruined valuable books, manuscripts and sketches and soon the palace fell into disrepair. In the 17th century Leopold I (1640 - 1705) had some of the more valuable artifacts from Ambras moved to Vienna where they remain in the Austrian National Library. In 1805 Ambras's remaining collection was threatened by the French after their victory over the Austrians but thankfully Napoleon instead had the collection safely sent to Vienna.In 1855 Archduke Karl Ludwig, governor of Tyrol, remodeled the palace to serve as his summer residence and as such the palace underwent major changes like the building of the Outer Bailey and the park being redesigned. After Ludwig renounced his succession in 1889 however the palace once again fell into disrepair and in 1880 it was again renovated, this time as a museum. In 1919 after the dissolution of Austria-Hungary Ambras fell into the hands of the new Austrian Republic and in 1950 the Kunsthistorisches Museum took over running the castle and its collection. Through the 1970s the Spanish Hall, the Upper Castle residential quarters and the inner courtyard were extensively restored. In 1974 the Chamber of Art and Wonders was built and in 1976 the Habsburg Portrait Gallery covering the 15th to 19th centuries was finished.",

The complex contains over a thousand buildings spread over nearly 400 acres and is the peak of Khmer architecture. The city of Angkor was the royal center of the Khmer dynasty and the hub of one of the largest, most prosperous and most sophisticated kingdoms in SouthEast Asia. From the end of the 9th century to the beginning of the 13th various construction projects were carried out with Angkor Wat being one of them. Built by Suryavarman II as a massive funerary temple to hold his remains, construction is thought to have taken around three decades to complete. All of the original religious motifs were Hindu and the temple was dedicated to Shiva, Brahma and Vishnu. The five central towers of the temple symbolize Mount Meru which according to the Hindu mythology is the home of the Gods. The mountain is said to be in the middle of an ocean at the edge of the world. A 617 ft bridge sits at the entrance with it leading into three galleries, each separated by a paved walkway. The temple walls were covered with bas-relief carvings of high quality depicting Khmer history, Hindu gods and scenes from the epic Sanskrit poems Mahabharata and Ramayana. After the Cham people sacked Angkor in 1177 King Jayvarman VII (1181 - 1220) turned his back on the Hindu gods who had, in his mind, failed him and his people. He built a new capital nearby, Angkor Thom which he dedicated to Buddhism. Afterwards Angkor Wat became a Bhuddist shrine and many of the Hindu carvings and sculptures were replaced with Buddhist ones. By the early 15th century Angkor was largely abandoned, only maintained by Theravada Buddhist monks. It was rediscovered by the French in 1863. In the early 20th century various attempts at restoration were undertaken but they fell apart as the region was engulfed in war in the 1970s. When work resumed in the 1980s the repairs needed were even more extensive. Some sections had to be completely dismantled and rebuilt. In 1992 the Angkor complex, including Angkor Wat, was added to the UNESCO World Heritage Site list and added to the list of World Heritage in Danger. Afterwards restoration efforts accelerated and in 2004 Angkor was removed from the Heritage in Danger list.

The site's strategic importance was because of its location along one of the main Trans-Saharan trade routes. The Tizi n'Tichka Pass, which was accessed through this route, was one of the few across the Atlas Mountains and acted as a crossing between Marrakech and the Draa Valley on the edge of the Sahara.

From 1044 to 1287 the city was the capital and beating heart of the Pagan Empire. Over a 250 year period nearly 10,000 religious monuments were built over a 40 square mile area. The city grew in prosperity and size and became an academic hub for the area with students coming from as far as India and Cambodia. The area's culture was heavily religious and a mix of all the prominent religions in the area including various Bhuddist and Hindu sects and local animist beliefs. While royal support would lead to Theravada Buddhists gaining prominence by the 11th century other religions would survive to varying degrees in the area. In 1287 the effects of Mongol invaders caught up with the city and it lost its prominence even if Mongol armies probably never reached the city itself. The city fell from a population of 50k - 200k to just a small town and was usurped in power by the Myinsaing Kingdom. The city survived as a pilgrimage destination with construction on new monuments slowing to just 200 built between the 15th and 20th centuries. Pilgrims flocked to a few notable monuments like the Ananda, the Shwezigon, the Sulamani and the Dhammayazika while the rest of them fell into disrepair and collapse. For those who hosted pilgrims however they continued to be upkept and even expanded with new frescos or statues added over time or even new additions to the temples themselves. A series of sponsored additions'' during the Konbaung period (1752 - 1885) however added many things not true to original designs like plaster. During the 1990s the Burmese military government undertook a program to restore many remaining pagodas to boost the country's tourism industry. They were however condemned by restorationists for adding, among other things, a paved highway, watchtower and a golf course.

A team of Dutch archeologists restored the site between 1907 and 1911 and another restoration was finished in 1987. Built with around 2 million cubic feet of volcanic stone Borobudur encloses a small hill and is shaped like a stepped pyramid with three major levels, a square base, a middle level made of five square terraces and an upper level of three circular terraces totalling, in effect, 9 lesser sections as the number 9 is important in Buddhism. The center, rising 115 ft above the base, consists of a large stupa. Each of its three main levels represents a stage on the way to the Bodhisattva ideal of Enlightenment; as a symbol of this journey a visiting pilgrim begins at the eastern stairway and walks clockwise around each of the nine levels before reaching the top, a distance of nearly 3 mi. At the lowest level which is still partly hidden, there are hundreds of reliefs of earthly desires illustrating Kama-Dhatu or The Realm of Feeling, the lowest sphere of the Mahayana Buddhist universe. On the next level a series of reliefs show Rupa-Dhatu or the Realm of Form through the events of the life of the Gautama Buddha and scenes from the Jatakas which were stories from his previous lives. The upper level symbolizes Arupa-Dhatu or the Realm of Formlessness or detachment from the physical world. There is little decoration but lining the terraces are 72 bell shaped stupas, many still housing a statue of the Buddah partially visible through the opened stonework.

The principle early buildings are done in the Puuc style which is a wild divergent style from other styles of the Southern lowlands. These early structures are south of the Main Plaza and include the Akab Dzib (House of the Dark Writing), Chichanchob (Red House), Iglesia (Church), Casa de las Monjas (Nursery), and the observatory El Caracol (The Snail). Evidence exists that after the Maya collapse in the 10th century Chichen was invaded by foreigners, probably Maya influenced by or under the direction of the Toltec of central Mexico. These invaders may have been the Itza for which the site is named however some also believe the Itza believe the Itza arrived 200 to 300 years later. Regardless of when they arrived, these invaders built some major buildings like El Castillo (The Castle), a 79ft pyramid rising above the Main Plaza. Castillo has four sides each with 91 stairs and facing a cardinal direction, including the step at the top platform that combines to a total of 365 steps, the same number of days in a year. During the spring and autumn equinoxes shadows cast by the setting sun make it look like a snake is going down the stairs. A carving of a plumed serpent at the top of the pyramid is symbolic of Quetzalcoatl (Kukulcan to the Maya), one of the major Mesoamerican deities. Excavations within the pyramid revealed another, earlier structure with a red jaguar throne studded with jade. Some other major buildings are the Ball Court (the largest in the Americas), The Temple of the Jaguars, the High Priest's Grave, the Thousand Columns and adjoining Temple of the Warriors. Most of these were built probably between 900 and 1200. From 1200 to 1540 Chichen Itza looks to have been eclipsed in power by the city of Mayapan. For a time Chichen Itza, Mayapan and Uxmal joined together in the League of Mayapan, a political confederacy. About 1450 the League fell apart as did Mayapan's political supremacy. When the Spanish arrived in the 16th century the Maya were spread across many small towns but many major cities including Cichen Itza were abandoned. Long left to nature, Chichen Itza remains sacred to the Maya. Excavations began in the 19th century and it is one of Mexico's prime archaeological sites.",

The project then stalled for centuries with a large wooden crane left standing 184 ft on the top of the south tower. During the 1790s troops of Revolutionary France occupied Cologne and used the cathedral as a stable and hay barn. Restoration efforts began in 1820 spurred on by the Gothic Revival Movement. In 1842 a new cornerstone was laid by King Frederick William IV of Prussia and work to finish the cathedral really began. Construction was guided by plans made around 1300 and finished in 1880. At the time of its finishing the Cathedral was believed to be the largest structure on Earth, a record held for four years until the completion of the Washington Monument in the US. It continued to be the world's tallest religious building until the Ulm Cathedral was finished in 1890. Allied air raids badly damaged the building in 1944 but the medieval windows had been removed before then. By 1948 the choir was restored and it was again regularly used as was the rest of the interior by 1956. In the late 20th century work began to repair acid rain damage on its stonework. The Cathedral's art treasures are many and varied. Near its high altar sits the massive golden Shrine of the Three Kings said to contain relics of the Magi who visited baby Jesus. The shrine, a masterpiece of medieval goldwork, was begun in 1182 and finished around 1220 and was originally housed in its predecessor cathedral. The altarpiece in the Lady Chapel on the south wall of the choir is a triptych named The Adoration of the Magi and was finished in 1445 and made by Stefan Lochner, one of the most famous Cologne painters.

The walls above the galleries and at the base of the Dome are covered with windows which in the daylight glare obscure the supports and make the canopy look to be floating. The original church on the site was said to be ordered by Constantine I in 325 on the foundations of a pagan temple. His son Constantinus II inaugurated it in 360. In 404 it was damaged by a fire started by a riot caused by the banishment of the Patriarch of Constantinople. It was rebuilt and expanded by Constans I with the restored building rededicated in 415 by Theodosius II. The church was again burned during the Nika riots in January of 532 giving Justinian the excuse for a grand replacement. The current building is essentially the 6th century building, although an earthquake in 558 caused a partial collapse of the dome which was restored in 562 followed by two smaller collapses which led to it being rebuilt to a smaller scale and being reinforced. In the mid 14th century it was again restored and for more than 1000 years it was the Cathedral of the Patriarch of Constantinople. In 1204 the Fourth Crusade led to the looting of the Cathedral along with most of Constantinople itself with many of its treasures being hauled back to Venice if not outright stolen. After the Ottoman sultan Mehmed II conquered Constantinople he had the church repurposed as a mosque and added wooden minarets, a grand chandelier, a mihrab which indicates the direction of Mecca and a minbar or pulpit. The red minaret which stands on the southwest corner of the Hagia was built either by him or his son Bayezid II. All the wooden minarets were eventually replaced. Bayezid II erected the narrow white one on the Northeast side of the mosque while the two identical western ones were commissioned by Selim II or Murad III in the 1500s. In 1934 Mustafa Kemal Ataturk, President of Turkey, secularized the building and in 1935 it was made a museum. Art historians say the building's mosaics are the main source of knowledge about the state of mosaic art just after the Iconoclast Controversy of the 8th and 9th centuries. In 1985 it became a UNESCO World Heritage site and in 2020, controversially, Tayyip Erdogan made the Hagia a mosque once more, holding prayers in it soon after even though visitors are still welcome.",

The king [Root.Monarch.GetName] of Naples had aimed to dissolve the feudal particularism and make the royal power the sole lever of the life of the country. In this context, the clash with the barons inevitably arose around the big problem of an organic reform of the state, the cornerstones of which were the reduction of baronial power, the development of economic life and the promotion of new entrepreneurs to the ruling class. Neapolitan merchants. An instrument of this policy was the fiscal reform, which entrusted new tasks to the municipal administrations (universities), encouraging them to escape, as far as possible, the feudal weight. And in truth it has been calculated that at that time in the Kingdom of Naples, out of 1550 inhabited centers, only a little more than 100 were assigned to the royal state property, that is, under the direct control of the king and the court, while all the others were controlled by the barons. This meant that the feudal power as a whole was the owner of the resources and finances of the kingdom and that the Aragonese court was in fact made subordinate to the baronial organization. It was therefore natural that the king favored in every way the numerical extension of the state-owned cities, removing them from the feudal weight and incorporating them into his own direct administration. But the undertaking was no small feat. The barons were organized into large, fairly branched dynasties, each of which alone controlled more lands than the king. The Orsini Del Balzo, for example, boasted of being able to travel from Taranto to Naples without ever leaving their possessions; the Sanseverinos, now opposed and now protected by the king, were owners of fiefs which from Calabria, through almost all of Basilicata, reached Salerno and lapped Naples; the Acquaviva, the Caldora, the Caracciolos, the Guevara and the Senerchia completed this small elite in power, which in fact surrounded the capital, suffocating the kingdom.",

The great losers of that war were Giovanni Antonio Orsini Del Balzo, the last prince of Taranto, who died in Altamura in [GetYear], perhaps suffocated by the king himself through the archpriest of that church, and Antonio Caldora, duke of Bari, who after having been captured in [GetYear] during the siege of Vasto was stripped of all possessions by the sovereign. The fact is that the Orsini del Balzo then lost the vast territory of the Principality of Taranto, which was confiscated by the court, until the Church, after not long, claimed its direct power over Altamura with greater force, thus providing the Del Balzo , feudal lords of the city, an ecclesiastical administration more free from respect for the King and more loyal and faithful to the baron, while the Caldora, after having lost all their territories with that defeat, distributed for the most part in Abruzzo, Molise, in Capitanata and in the land of Bari, they never got up again. In short, the war against the barons of 1459-[GetYear] had ended bitterly, but with a clear victory for the king. He had then been able to resume his policy with greater certainty, innovating in fiscal and feudal legislation, that is, mortifying the baronial prerogatives, extending the power of the court and the state, reorganizing the economic and commercial life of the kingdom.

A patroon could create civil and criminal courts, appoint local officials and hold land in perpetuity. In return, he was required by the Dutch West India Company to establish a settlement of at least 50 families within four years on the land, or ship fifty colonists to it within four year.

It emphasizes flowing movements rather than fixed stances; the ginga, a rocking step, is usually the focal point of the technique. Several groups of enslaved persons who liberated themselves gathered and established settlements, known as quilombos, in remote and hard-to-reach places would develop this martial art.

Starting in the Carribean, Spanish policies began to be implemented elsewhere in the new world and the Phillipines, which was accelerated by the loosening grip Spain had on its Andean subjects. Spain thus sought to aggrandize its power by consolidating viceregal rule and reviving the flow of Andean silver to the metropolitan treasury.

Shortly after the Spanish colonization of the Americas was initiated, several regulations were enacted in the Laws of the Indies to prevent Jews and Muslims and their descendants from emigrating to and settling in the overseas colonies. Within the colonies, the idea of purity also applied to the indigenous.

It soon became clear that the audiencia system would not be sufficient to effectively run the overseas government. Viceroys were therefore introduced and audiencias were given a consultative and quasi-legislative role in the administration of the territories. Both viceroys and audiencias were ultimately overseen by a Council of the Indies. Unlike their peninsular counterparts, the overseas audiencias had legislative and executive functions in addition to their judicial ones, and thus represented the king in his role as maker of laws and dispenser of justice",

Militarily, they aimed to strengthen the coastal fortifications, increasing the size of local garrisons by raising more colonial troops, and to rotate units between Spain and its colonies on a regular basis. The military reforms in themselves did not alter social relationships, but since the military buildup in Spain proper limited the means available for colonial defense, the reformers decided to arm the colonial population. Hence, a disciplined and organized permanent militia was created. Although mainly consisting of criollos, it was still considered new and dangerous to arm any others than peninsulares.

This caused some tension from both authorities on the one had the Serbs claiming they were heretics to orthodoxy and on the other you had the venetians calling the heretics catholics as well.

Some refused to agree with this, especially the Serbs and the austrians. But those that do recognize them for what they are love them. The unique thing about the Kristjani church is that they took certain aspects of the old church literally. For example the fact they made their churches and monasteries in the mountains or cliff sides like the christians of old. These things are nothing more or less special from any other churches and monasteries however this provides a place for the population to wither invasions and wars.

While the sipahi form their own distinctive social classes, and are often in rivalry with the Janissaries, their skills as cavalrymen make them a show of force on the battlefield. Utilising the Timar system, Timariots are granted a fief of land directly by the Ottoman sultan or with his official permission by beylerbeys. They are entitled to all of the income from that land, in return for military service. The peasants on the land are subsequently attached thereto, granting the Timariots similar status to contemporary knights. In wartime, Timarli sipahis and their retainers were gathered under their alay-beys. The equipment and tactics differ between the Anatolian and Balkan Timarli Sipahi. The Anatolian Sipahi were equipped and fought as classic horse archers, shooting while galloping, yet they weren't nomadic cavalry and their status was similar to medium cavalry class. Balkan Timarli Sipahis wore chainmail, rode barded horses and carried lances and javelins, and fought as medium cavalry.",

These institutions evolved from the practice by the Ottoman leaders in Anatolia of employing captured prisoners as mercenary troops. Later on, during the conquest of the Balkans, the Turks, with the religious sanction of the grand mufti, took as tribute from the Christian population a percentage of the male children. These became the 'slaves of the sultan'. Completely severed from their Christian families, these children were brought up as Muslims and imbued with religious devotion to Islam and loyalty to the sultan. The more able were enrolled in the palace corps of pages and trained to become administrators and officials into the Sublime Porte. The remainder were given a military education and became members of the Janissary corps, one of the best trained and most effective soldiers in Europe.",

After that a goodly tree sprang forth, which grew in beauty and in strength, ever greater and greater. Still did the embracing verdure of its boughs and branches cast an ampler and an ampler shade, until they canopied the extreme horizon of the three parts of the world. Under the tree stood four mountains, which he knew to be Caucasus, Atlas, Taurus, and Haemus. These mountains were the four columns that seemed to support the dome of the foliage of the sacred tree with which the earth was now centered. From the roots of the tree gushed forth four rivers, the Tigris, the Euphrates, the Danube, and the Nile. Tall ships and barks innumerable were on the waters. The fields were heavy with harvest. The mountain sides were clothed with forests. Thence in exulting and fertilizing abundance sprang fountains and rivulets that gurgled through thickets of the cypress and the rose. In the valleys glittered stately cities, with domes and cupolas, with pyramids and obelisks, with minarets and towers. The Crescent shone on their summits",

Although many decisions were taken outside the formal context of the Imperial Council, it was the main executive body of the Empire, conducting all kinds of tasks of government such as the conduct of foreign relations, including the reception of foreign ambassadors, the preparation of campaigns, the construction of fortifications and public buildings, the reception of reports from the provincial governors and the appointments to state office, as well as continuing to function as a court of law, particularly for members of the military class.",

It threatened the coastal cities of the Arabian Peninsula and India. The headquarters of the Portuguese navy was in Goa, a city on the west coast of India, in 1510. Ottoman control of the Red Sea meanwhile began in 1517 when Selim I annexed Egypt to the Ottoman Empire after the Battle of Ridaniya. Most of the habitable zone of the Arabian Peninsula soon fell voluntarily to the Ottomans. Selim entered into negotiations with Sultan Muzaffar II of Gujarat, about a possible joint strike against the Portuguese in Goa, which would be officially ratified following a joint Mamlukean-Gujarat-Calicut naval coalition that the Sultan aided in, even though the Battle of Diu was a major loss. The naval expeditions in the Indian Ocean were only partially successful. The original goals of checking Portuguese domination in the ocean and assisting a Muslim Indian lord were, naturally enough, not achieved. On the other hand, Yemen, as well as the west bank of the Red Sea, roughly corresponding to a narrow coastal strip of Sudan and Eritrea, were annexed by Özdemir Pasha, the deputy of Hadim Suleiman Pasha. Three more provinces in East Africa were established in Massawa, Habesh and Sawakin. The ports around the Arabian Peninsula were also secured. Ottoman assistance to Aceh in 1569 is also considered to be a part of these expeditions. However, that expedition was not a military expedition.",

The Danube Fortifications consisted of a series of forts, towers, and walls that were built at strategic locations along the river, including at the mouths of major tributaries and at key points along the river's course.

Finally, this tradition culminated in the Acts of Union. Starting with the abolishment of centuries of laws reflecting hostility between two nations, it then rebranded the kingdom title to better suit the nations' new identity, resolved trade disputes, granted special status to local customs, and guaranteed the freedom of the local state church.

The culmination of this intense but peaceful exchange of ideas led to the Confessio Tetrapolitana, where Straßburg and three other cities produced their own confession of faith and submitted it to the Imperial Diet along with the Augsburg Confession of more strict Lutheranism. Holding a mediating position between Luther and the early Reformed, such as Zwingli, it is seen as simultaneously a Lutheran and an early Reformed confession, illustrating perfectly that Straßburg was as much a beating heart of the Reformation and its theology as Wittenberg or Geneva.",

Because it is difficult to maintain for long periods of time, troops typically only begin to goose-step when they approach the reviewing stand and return to a normal march step once they have marched past. Large military parades require several days of practice to ensure that troops can perform the goose step without injuring themselves. Preparatory training includes having soldiers march in small groups, with arms linked to maintaining balance.\\n\\nIn the most rigorous form of the goose step, often found in guard mounting ceremonies, the pace is done at a slow march, and the leg is nearly horizontal, and sometimes well beyond. In a standard goose step, found in large military parades, the pace is done at a quick march and the leg is raised only to knee-height, or even to calf height. The lower goose step improves balance and unit cohesion at the tempo of a quick march. Flagbearers and honor guards will frequently march with a higher goose step than the mass of troops following.",

This would all take place around 834 after the tiny castle at Hamburg no longer seemed suitable for an archbishop. The seat was moved to Bremen in 848 it changed the name to the archbishopric of Bremen-Hamburg. It was effectively put in charche to christianize the slavs and scandinavians; it did so with varying success in its 300 year function. Then in 1158 the duke of Holstein after the loss of Lübeck searched for a new trading port and found Hamburg to be ideal, founding the market town of Neu Hamburg next to Altstadt Hamburg which was a small city that had formed around the old Hammaburg.

They were technically a city loyal to the duke of Holstein but Hamburg played its cards right. It had already achieved semi independence from the duke since it was granted both its imperial trade privileges and its imperial right to police and prosecute in its own realm. However they maintained the position of being a Holsteiner city and not a free city because that would not only require imperial recognition which they didn't have but would also limit them in their actions legally. For example it would mean they could no longer purchase new lands or sell them. It would also mean they could no longer confiscate church land since they fell under the empire's direct control if they were to become a free city. They achieved this position due to the fact that in 1439 the Danish crown gained a union with Holstein but due to their practical independence they weren't included in the union. Of course to the great pleasure of the imperial crown Hamburg remained in the empire. The city council would convince the emperor to keep them a Holsteiner city instead of declaring a free one to maintain the empire's claim over Holstein. So it was that Hamburg came to enjoy all the privileges that came with being a free city without the bureaucratic red tape and legal restrictions of one. Making it effectively the only true republic of the empire. What changed in 1768 however is that the title of Holstein was effectively abandoned by the emperors. So the diplomatic justification for Hamburg ambivalence was no longer needed; the empire was in decline and the emperor needed money. This would lead to the decision to make Hamburg a free city putting it under the direct control and leadership of the emperor.",

Then you had the inner council which consisted of a set group of Ancient families, aristocrats or not that had been credited with one of the cities founding families. The members of these councils would act like the supreme rulers of the city but as a council. They would be the final authority and act like judges or a president ratifying laws and imposing the cities laws.

This all came ahead during the Handwerkeraufstand or the craftsman revolt. The artisans would however lose this and the guilds would be disbanded and.

It was introduced into German military tradition by Leopold I, Prince of Anhalt-Dessau. The goose step is a difficult marching style that takes much practice and coordination. It is therefore reserved for ceremonial occasions such as military parades. Because it is difficult to maintain for long periods of time, troops typically only begin to goose-step when they approach the reviewing stand and return to a normal march step once they have marched past. Large military parades require several days of practice to ensure that troops can perform the goose step without injuring themselves. Preparatory training includes having soldiers march in small groups, with arms linked to maintaining balance.\\n\\nIn the most rigorous form of the goose step, often found in guard mounting ceremonies, the pace is done at a slow march, and the leg is nearly horizontal, and sometimes well beyond. In a standard goose step, found in large military parades, the pace is done at a quick march and the leg is raised only to knee-height, or even to calf height. The lower goose step improves balance and unit cohesion at the tempo of a quick march. Flagbearers and honor guards will frequently march with a higher goose step than the mass of troops following.",

It provided not only basic technical skills needed in a modernizing world but also music and religious education in close cooperation with the churches and tried to impose a strict ethos of duty, sobriety, and discipline. Mathematics and calculus were not compulsory at the start, and taking such courses required additional payment by parents.

The title of archduchy is in effect a kingdom and not a duchy. Due to the late Hohenstaufen reforms it became legally impossible to form any new kingdoms within the empire itself, but there are ways around that. One of these methods is what Prussia did and that is to include your imperial duchy into a kingdom outside of the empire. They made their title duces of Brandenburg Kings in prussia not of prussia, the wording is legally important. A second method is what the Babenbergs did in Austria. Requesting the pope to elevate a duchy title to an Archduchy giving its Arch dukes divine right which usually is exclusive to kings. But by request they were given divine rights and united Austria and Styria into an Archduchy. The second thing that it did was to secure the autonomy and independence of Styria from The duchy of Austria within the archduchy.

Literally “Imperial Freedom,” also known as “Imperial Immediacy,” this was a privileged status that made the Swabian city-states answer to no lord but the Emperor himself. In practice, this resulted in a high degree of self-governance, creating a balance of power and healthy competition between states in times of peace, while allowing for much more power as a whole in times of war.

The noble intention of preaching Islam was the main factor which drove them to leave their hearth and home for Bengal. They came to Bengal, often alone, and preached Islam in the secluded areas throughout their lives under unfavourable circumstances. While the social and religious condition of the people was caste divided, the Sufis came here carrying with them the egalitarian message of Islam. Because of their strong belief in Allah, and theoretical and practical teachings of universal brotherhood, Sufis could easily satisfy the spiritual cravings of the masses.

They showed great tolerance towards Jews by welcoming them from the earliest days of their presence in the city, and Ferrara became a reference point for exiles from Spain and Portugal, perhaps one of the few alternatives to Prague. And from the Jews they received enormous advantages, obtaining improvements in ducal businesses and, not infrequently, economic support for their businesses.

In this financial loan operation, called purchase, the Genoese State commits a part of the ordinary income against payment of the annual fruit to a company of lending citizens called comperisti who advance the capital, obliging themselves to repay the capital within the pre-established term. Given the success, the operation was periodically repeated in the following years, growing at the beginning of the fourteenth century. The historical occasion of the constitution of the Casa delle compere e dei benchi di San Giorgio was the financial collapse of the Compagna Communis (this was the name of the medieval town of Genoa before it became a republic), caused by the harsh wars against Venice. The body was founded by a state provision with a decree of 27 April 1407 from the meeting of all the already existing purchases, which had made loans to the State, to manage the public debt of the Compagna Communis in a unitary way.

The first rules in this regard date back to the mid-fourteenth century - the rules of Gazaria, ancient name of the Crimea - which deal precisely with the galleys used for trade with the colonies on the Black Sea. The rules of Gazaria is one of the oldest sources of maritime law in Europe. In 1559 with the peace of Cateau Cambresis, which put an end to the war between the allied Spain and France and after the battle of Lepanto (1576), the need was felt for a permanent, public fleet.

Once the previous Arsenal Magistrate was suppressed, the task of ordering and following the construction of new boats was assigned to that of the Galleys. The seven constituent members of this Magistrate took the title of Provisori. They enslaved the enemies, but they worried about the fate of their fellow citizens, completely ignoring any concept of equality and the essential value of all human life. It is clear that, with those treatments, the convicts had a short life and that a continuous turnover on board the galleys was therefore necessary. In 1646 a new kind of crew was established for the galleys, no longer made up of slaves but rather of free men, regularly paid for their work. The galleys of liberty were born, driven no longer by the force of arms of the convicts, but by the work of volunteers, who will be called buonavoglia.",

In the final stages of the Giudicato it was Sassari that became the capital (even before that there was Ardara, always chosen for the same reasons). The Giudicato ceased to exist in 1259 with Adelasia di Torres. After the dissolution of the Giudicato di Torres the city was absorbed by the free municipality of Sassari.

The Persian carpet reached its zenith during the reign of the Safavid Dynasty, when Shah Abbas encouraged contacts and trade with Europe and transformed his new capital, Isfahan, into one of the most glorious cities of Persia. He also built workshops for carpets where skilled designers and craftsmen set to work to create splendid specimens. Most of these carpets were made of silk, with gold and silver threads adding even more embellishment.",
			"hie_per_jazayer": "The Jazayer",
			"hie_per_jazayer_desc": "The Jazayer, a flintlock musket, used by these infantrymen was of a much heavier caliber than their European counterparts and consequently had a greater range as well as improved accuracy. Unlike European muskets, however, the jazayer was loaded using a horn rather than a paper cartridge meaning although the jazayer had the advantages of range, the force of impact, and accuracy, it took longer to reload than the standard European muskets of the era. One of the earliest recordings of Persian soldiers using jazayers in combat dates back to the mid-seventeenth century.",

The size of this cavalry body fluctuated with time but at one point it was reported as 70,000 strong. Elements within the Savaran-e Sepah-e Khorasan were occasionally promoted by Nader to the Savaran-e Saltanati.

The Tofangchi was the regular corps of musketeers, while the Jazayerchi were the elite gunners of Nader's personal army. During his reign, the importance of infantry began to be realized in Persian Armies, whereas they previously were second to the cavalry. Jazayerchi units engaged in training for several hours every day. A clear emphasis was given to the constant drilling of the soldiers. Nader shaped the jazayerchi corps himself and often took personal command of them in battle. According to another contemporary, the jazayerchi were well-uniformed and provided with the best equipment. Although the Jazayerchi was an infantry corps they usually campaigned on mounts and occasionally fought as mounted troops also. They were used to achieve the hardest and most crucial tactical tasks due to their high quality as elite fighting troops, proving their worth in many battles including Mihmandust, Murche-Khort, Kirkuk, Yeghevard, Karnal and Kars.",

			"hie_swe_reformation": "Liturgiska Striden",

Good discipline is vital for the Carolean's highly aggressive tactics, which required them to keep in formation and hold their fire as they approached the enemy, even if coming under a hail of bullets themselves. Carolean fight not just for the king, but for god itself, as they believe they are crusading against heretics and heathens. In fact, fatalism is induced to ensure soldiers have no fear, since if God wanted them to survive then nothing could harm them, and conversely if He had decreed that they were to die then death would come even if they tried to flee.
